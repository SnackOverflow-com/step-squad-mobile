# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

General note for adding different github account for a specific project:

1. Navigate to project:

```
cd /path/to/project
```

2. Set the Git user name and email locally for this repository only:

```
git config user.name "Your Personal GitHub Username"
git config user.email "your.personal.email@example.com"
```

3. Verify the configuration was applied correctly:

```
git config --local user.name
git config --local user.email
```

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Code Formatting with Prettier

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to maintain consistent code formatting. The configuration is defined in `.prettierrc.js`.

### Format your code

To format all files in the project:

```bash
npm run format
```

### Check if your code is formatted

To check if files need formatting without making changes:

```bash
npm run format:check
```

### VSCode Integration

For the best development experience with VSCode:

1. Install the [Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
2. Add these settings to your VSCode workspace settings:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
}
```

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
